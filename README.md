# Sk8spots

My first real website made on univesity as part of a project.

## Idea

A website focused on the skateboard community. It has as main goal helping skaters from all modalities to find new spots.

## My own impressions

As this was made without any previous experience with web development I think it's ok. I wouldn't say that is attractive for users, because I hadn't any idea how to do many things. But I'll probably get back to it at some point and to it better! :)

# Getting back

Currently working on a new version using React + Typescript, the main goal is to make it mobile-first. New features are also on the way.
