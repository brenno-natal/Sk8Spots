# Sk8spots

That's my first real website made on univesity as part of a project.

## Idea

A website focused on the skateboard community. It has as main goal helping skaters from all modalities to find new spots.

## My own impressions

As this was made without any previous experience with web development I think it's ok. It's not a website that I would say it's engaging for users, because I hadn't any idea how to do most part of it. But I'll probably get back to it at some point and to it better! :)
